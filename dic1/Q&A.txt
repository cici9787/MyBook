Q:1.how do improve scalability?
A:
1.Moularize
split the system into small,independent modules
2.Microservices
break the system into tiny services that work seperately
3.Loose coupling(低耦合)
different parts of system don't depend too much on each other.

Technology
1.Scalable Database: HBase
2.Cloud Platform: AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud
3.Caching: Redis
redis stores data that's used often, so the system can fetch data faster and doesn't have to the database every time.

Data partitioning: divide data into smaller parts and store them in different places.
Monitor and Alarm: monitor the system and set up alarms to notify you when something goes wrong.
