Q:how to block inapproprite images.
Develop Custom Machine Learning Models
    (1)Confirm the standards and annotation specifications for this scenario.
    Build a high-quality labeled dataset.
    tagsï¼š"safe", "pornographic", "violent", etc.
    (2)Model Selection and Training: CNN
    (3)Model Evaluation and Optimization:
    using evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
    Through the misclassified cases to identify the weakness of the model.
    Improve the model, adjusting network structure, fine-tuning hyperparameters,
    adding more relevant data.
    Deployment and Inference

URL-Based Filtering:
maintain a blacklist of URLs, check the image source url, if the url is on blacklist,
the image can be blocked.

Human-Machine Collaboration:
 For images that are difficult to judge accurately by the machine - learning model alone, a human moderation team can be involved.
