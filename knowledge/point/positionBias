In ranking and recommendation system, how to deal with position bias.

(1) Data collection and preprocessing
stratified sampling: use stratified sampling to ensure samples from different
positions are evenly distributed.
data augmentation: use augment for less-represented positions.
(2) Model design and training
(a)position-aware features: add a feature indicating the position in ranking to the
input of the model.allow the model to consider impact of the position on user's
behavior.
(b) use unbiased estimator.Instead of using the traditional CTR as the evaluation
metric, use unbiased estimators such as inverse propensity-weighted estimator.
This estimator correct the bias by postion throught weighting the clicks according
to the probability of the itembeing shown in particular postion.
(c) Regularization.Apply regularization to prevent the model from over-fitting the
position-related features.Use L1 or L2 to penalize large weights assigned to position-
related features.

P(y = 1|x, pos) = P(seen | pos) * P(Y|x, seen)
add features
change models to predict probility of seen.
