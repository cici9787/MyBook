1.Problem Navigition
问问题, 3-5个问题, 澄清是什么场景什么功能
what's the UI look like?
what the main features?
what the scale?
what are the metrics I want to improve?

2.Over all idea
draw the architecture, a graph to demonstrate the architecture

3.write down for each component?
it should include:
(1)Features
    [1]User features: demographic, features, age, gender, location, L28,
    UIH-user interactive history(DIN, SIM, HSTU)
    [2]Social network: todo search for facebook social network feature
    [3]Video feature: video length, content embedding(NLP, visual embedding CLIP/VIT)
    [4]Engagement counts:
        user counts: avg vv10s, avg like CTR, avg comment CTR.
        video counts:

    normalization: standardization (mean 0 std 1), min-max normalization [-1, 1]
    sparse: IDs -> hash -> embedding table, 经常问的how to prevent hash collision

(2)Data
    Data log join
        Feature: backend -> Hive
        Labels(user actions): Frontend -> Hive
        Join: (feature, label) pairs
    Recurrent training:
        Daily training: aggregate data -> train model -> deploy online
        Online learning: data join is streaming -> online training of model -> deploy model online


(3)Metrics
    Offline metric: AUC, NE
    Online metric: time spent, impression(ads revenue)
(4)Monitoring
    Monitor infra metics(QPS, latency)
    Monitor model accuracy metrics(online AUC)
(5)Modeling
    Monitor infra metrics(QPS, latency)
    Monitor model accuracy metrics(online AUC)




typical questions:
1. hash table
2. hash collasion
3. embedding table
